                            CHITTOOR AND East Godavari in Andhra Pradesh have become the worst Covid-19 affected
                            districts even
                            as Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy called for focussed testing and hastened
                            vaccination.
                            <br><br>
                            The CM called on health workers, district collectors, police and village and ward
                            secretariat staff
                            to work with the same spirit as last year as Covid-19 cases have started rising again.
                            <br><br>
                            Chittoor with 1,00,254 cases and 918 deaths and East Godavari with 1,29,312 cases and 638
                            deaths are
                            the worst affected, according to officials.
                            <br><br>
                            Deputy Chief Minister Alla Krishna Srinivas (Health) said Andhra Pradesh has conducted 1.55
                            crore
                            tests since last year and 9.37 lakh samples have been tested positive. The positivity rate
                            in the
                            state is 6.03 per cent while the recovery rate is 96.19 per cent. The national average
                            recovery rate
                            is 88.9 per cent. While the death rate in the state is 0.78 per cent, it is 1.24 per cent at
                            the
                            national level.
                            <br><br>
                            The second wave has seen the number of cases rise very quickly and from December to April,
                            the
                            positivity rate was 7.77 per cent. While the rate of infection and positivity is higher in
                            Chittoor
                            followed by Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, Krishna, Guntur and Nellore districts.
                            <br><br>
                            The CM told officials that the government is trying to get more vaccine doses to the state
                            to resume the vaccination drive.
                            <br><br>
                            Ruling out the possibility of imposing another lockdown, the CM said that last yearâ€™s
                            lockdown had worsened the financial situation and people suffered a lot and Covid should be
                            controlled without imposing lockdown this time.
                            <br><br>
                            The health minister said that the focus is back on focused testing: testing the primary
                            contacts of those who have tested positive for Covid. Test results have revealed that
                            positive cases were 62 per cent in the urban areas and 38 per cent in the rural areas.
                            <br><br>
                            However, the mortality rate is higher in rural areas. Deaths are higher in rural areas as
                            they are going to the hospitals too late, officials said. District collectors have been
                            asked to restart surveys by Asha health workers and Covid-19 volunteers to identify people
                            with symptoms.
                            <br><br>
                            Officials said that 108 hospitals in the state were empanelled for Covid treatment and out
                            of 15,669 beds in those hospitals, 4,889 are occupied as of April 18.
                            <br><br>
                            The government has directed health and district officials to increase the availability of
                            beds in the hospitals.
                            <br><br>
                            About 13,500 beds are available in Covid care centres and the government is making efforts
                            to increase the number of beds to 50,000. It has also decided to take stringent action
                            against private hospitals, which charge more money for Covid treatment.
