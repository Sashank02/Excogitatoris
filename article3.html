                            A government panel studying Covid-19 vaccine side effects has confirmed the first death due
                            to anaphylaxis following vaccination. The National AEFI Committee carried out causality
                            assessment of 31 reported AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunisation) cases, and said the
                            death of a 68-year-old man had been attributed to a severe allergic reaction following
                            vaccination on March 8.

                            â€œIt is the first death linked to Covid-19 vaccination due to anaphylaxis. It re-emphasises
                            the need to wait for 30 minutes at the inoculation centre after receiving the jab, Dr N K
                            Arora, Chairperson, National AEFI Committee, told PTI.

                            The panel, which released data for vaccinations only till the first week of April, examined
                            five deaths reported following vaccination on February 5, eight cases from March 9 and 18
                            cases from March 31.
                            <br> <br>
                            As per the panel, while the reporting rate was 2.7 deaths and 4.8 hospitalisations per
                            million vaccine doses administered, it did not automatically imply that the deaths or
                            hospitalisations were caused due to vaccines. Only proper investigation and causality
                            assessments can help establish any causal relationship, the report said.

                            It classified 18 of the 31 cases it assessed as having inconsistent causal association to
                            vaccination (coincidental, not linked to vaccination); 7 as indeterminate; 3 as
                            vaccine-product related, 1 as anxiety-related reaction; and 2 as unclassifiable.

                            Vaccine-product related reactions were expected reactions, the panel said. Indeterminate
                            reactions are reactions occurring soon after vaccination but with no definitive evidence in
                            current literature or clinical trial data to show this could have been caused due to the
                            vaccine.
                            <br><br>
                            Unclassifiable events are events which have been investigated but there is not enough
                            evidence for assigning a diagnosis due to missing crucial information.

                            Coincidental events are events reported following immunisation for which a clear cause other
                            than vaccination has been found.
